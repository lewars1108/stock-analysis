In 2018, ENPH and RUN were the only stocks to return an investment. DQ, specifically, did increase in total daily volume, but showed a return of -62.6%. In retrospect, the stock market overall did see a dive. Steve would benefit in looking into the two green stocks that stood firm during this time, and suggest ENPH and RUN to diversify his parents portfolio.

Summary

The advantages of refactoring code, is that it speeds up the process of your project. Most of the time, what you are trying to create has been done before and is available to you. Refactoring code, can also cut out the redundancy of coding when only a few factors have to be changed. The disadvantages of refactoring code is that you can get confused by the formatting of code, since there are many ways to get the same result. You can get tripped up in this, and introduce errors into the code.

The pro of refactoring the original code was that, ultimately the code was identical, yeilding the same result and once refactored, the run times decreased. The cons of refactoring the original code was that I did introduce errors when creating my arrays which followed through to my If statements.
